          <p>JavaScript is used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites">almost every website on the internet</a>, so I embarked on a quest to find the best active JavaScript blogs for programmers. Each of these sites demonstrates technical expertise, is relatively easy to comprehend, publishes content consistently, and has stood the test of time.</p>
    
    <p>During this process, I used a consistent approach to analyze and compare common qualities (or deficiencies) in each blog. I looked at the depth of each blog’s <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/technical-content">technical content</a> and the usefulness of that content. I read a few posts from start to finish to get a sense of the writing quality and comprehensibility. I looked at how consistently each web dev blog publishes new content, and I did some digging to learn how long each site has been around. Most of these blogs are similar in that they offer in-depth articles on other areas of <a href="https://st.sendbird.com/developer/tutorials/how-to-build-chat-for-a-fintech-app">JavaScript app development</a>, making them ideal blogs for programmers.</p>
    
    <p>Based on those criteria, here are the 26 best JavaScript blogs I could find:</p>
    
    <h3 id="1-ben-nadel">1. <strong><a href="https://www.bennadel.com/blog/complete-blog-entry-list.htm">Ben Nadel</a></strong></h3>
    
    <p>Ben Nadel is a NY-based programmer, co-founder, and principal engineer at InVision App, Inc, a design and user experience (UX) company. His blog — sometimes known as “The Kinky Solutions” blog — documents his programming experimentation. The blog has a huge collection of useful and in-depth articles which is a treasure trove for any web developer looking for blogs for programmers. The nearly 15-year-old blog is an excellent vector for demonstrating Nadel’s technical expertise and strong technical programming knowledge. The blog’s writing quality is excellent, and I found it clean, concise, and thought-provoking. The consistency in which he posts articles (several new articles every month) adds to it being one of the best programming blogs for web developers.</p>

    <p><img src="t9Sx26n.png" alt="CSS Tricks home page" width="100%"></p>
    
    <p>CSS Tricks is a web dev blog that’s been active on Front End Development and building websites since 2007. Their army of writers publishes articles on tangible programming exercises and strategies, and the content is as diverse as the writers themselves. They have some for-sale books and merchandise confined to a sales part of the site, leaving articles unencumbered. While every author is different, the writing style and content is top-notch, well-organized, and features a plethora of applicable visuals and interactive code samples. Articles range in length but are generally thorough and technical. The subject matter can be simple but is commonly moderate to advanced with proportionately advanced explanations. I found they publish multiple posts per week and are one of the more popular web dev blogs.</p>

    <p>SmashingMagazine is an independent programming publication that posts articles written by and for developers making it the quintessential blog for programmers. The blog’s articles range in topics, but are all applicable to web programmers. My only knocks on them are the full-screen in-text ads and company promotions. All articles are written and reviewed by programmers to ensure their usefulness and legitimacy. Look for articles of moderate to expert technical proficiency without any personal rambles or filler. The blog is published multiple times per week on a consistent basis. The blog’s writing quality is mostly excellent, with minor grammatical blemishes that don’t take away from the content. Each article features several supporting visuals and links, which helps speak to programmers in any language.</p>

The blog is a collection of articles written solely by Rachel, many of which are hosted on Smashing Magazine or the Notist blog. However, they are widely applicable, and concentrate on programming, business,  and conferences. Articles are professionally written, and Rachel’s points are articulate. The blog is published roughly once per month and has been since 2005. Though topics are beginner to intermediate-level, they are thoroughly explained with great detail and authority.</p>

Since 2011, he has been blogging at 2ality.com and has written several books on JavaScript. The blog is a collection of hundreds of different Javascript commands, functions, and projects. The content is very thorough and demonstrates strong technical proficiency across the board. This web dev blog is published at least once a month, sometimes as many as several new articles in the same span. The writing quality is dense and informative, but a little dry. Articles are text-heavy with lots of code snapshots, but barely any links or visuals.</p>

    <p>Zeldman is a personal blog by Jeffrey Zeldman, a well-known web designer, formerly of Automattic, Co-Founder of The Web Standards Project, and writer of two books on web standards. The blog is an interesting look into a decorated web designer’s mind but doesn’t offer much for a new web developer. You might find more useful information in his books or courses. While Zeldman is an experienced web developer, the articles’ topics don’t get quite as technical as other blogs on this list. Zeldman is an excellent writer who has a strong command of language. Articles do not feature many images but are strewn with relevant links. The blog is published multiple times per month without any sort of schedule.</p>

    <p>CSS Wizardry is the blog of Harry Roberts, an award-winning independent Web Engineering Consultant. He has worked with well-known organizations such as Google, the BBC, The UN, and General Electric. The blog’s archive of articles consists solely of technical tips and tricks Harry has used while working with high-profile clients. Therefore, they are highly applicable and should offer excellent value or insight for any front end developer. Articles are well-written and clear, and supporting evidence is abundant. The content shows technical knowledge of the subject, but the concepts are probably most useful for moderate to advanced developers. Regarding the publishing schedule, there is no degree of consistency; you would be lucky to see one new post per month.</p>

Marmelab’s posts demonstrate a strong technical knowledge of the subject matter and use ample evidence to support the article’s point. The blog is updated on average at least a couple of times every month, sometimes with a handful of new posts. The blog’s writing is extremely dense and informative, but could use some polish on its grammar.</p>

    <p>DHTMLX is a Javascript UI framework that provides high-speed web and mobile app development with customizable HTML5 UI controls. This blog is more applicable if you use DHTMLX, but even without, there is some value to be extracted here. Predictably, many of the blog’s articles are product updates or tutorials specifically for their product suite. However, there is a healthy amount of otherwise relevant but non-company promotional pieces. The blog is strictly technical, and thus posts are geared towards active developers familiar with programming fundamentals. This developer blog’s writing quality is not perfect but compares well against other company blogs. Articles are formatted sensibly and utilize a variety of supporting images and code examples. The blog is published regularly, but not exclusively limited to Javascript.</p>

    <p>Stuff and Nonsense is a web design blog by Andy Clarke, a well-known Welsh web designer who has worked with WWF, Greenpeace, Disney Store UK, Home Office UK, and more. There are two content sections: “Articles” and “Blogs,” both of which contain ample posts on design concepts and styles. While this may be useful for a web designer, a web developer may be less intrigued without a mention of code on the blog in years. While the articles show understanding of web design concepts and machinations, they remain on the surface level and make no attempt to touch upon code or programming details. Clarke’s writing is excellent and has minor blemishes. The blog’s content is informative and includes relevant links and visuals, but it’s more of a blog for designers rather than a developer blog.</p>

His technical writing spans back nearly 15 years and provides heavily technical pieces that let the code do the talking. Articles are decently written, but it’s the information that is most valuable.

    <p>Nodesource is a platform that enables organizations to build, manage, secure, and analyze Node.js applications. The majority of articles are product updates and demos, but some articles dive into Node.js. Nodesource’s posts are technically sound and provide enterprise-level JavaScript expertise. This node js blog’s content is superbly written, both in content and grammar, and there are minimal errors and ample sources for the reader. The blog sees anywhere from 1-4 new posts each month.</p>

    <h3 id="22-reginald-braithewait">22. <strong><a href="http://raganwald.com/">Reginald Braithewait</a></strong></h3>
    
    <p>Reginald Braithewait is a programmer whose interests include constructing surreal numbers, deconstructing hopelessly egocentric nulls, and celebrating the joy of programming. He is the author of JavaScript Allongé, CoffeeScript Ristretto, and raganwald.com and develops user experiences at PagerDuty. While the articles on his blog are insightful, my only knock is that there isn’t a deep archive of content. Braithewait’s articles are extremely thorough, and the blog’s content quality is very high. Though it has an occasional spelling or grammar blunder, it is otherwise strongly written and laden with supporting evidence. Unfortunately, it has become decreasingly consistent with the publishing of new content since its launch in 2008.</p>

    <h3 id="23-codeshare">23. <strong><a href="https://codeshare.co.uk/">Codeshare</a></strong></h3>
    
    <p>The blog’s topics are mostly tutorials and troubleshooting guides for common technical issues. They are a collection of experiences and methods used by active programmers and would serve useful to other Web Developers as well. Most articles are relatively short-form but technical nonetheless. A small crew of writers shows their programming prowess, which frankly supersedes minor grammar issues so long as programmers reading the articles get the point. Images and supporting links are frequently used to boost content quality. Codeshare’s focus on video tutorials make it a great space to learn and enhance your skill set adding to its reputation as a highly engaging developer blog. Expect a couple of sporadic posts per month.</p>

    <p>JS Manifest is a niche blog that covers JavaScript for web development, smartphones, desktops, robots, AI, and more. The blog consists of detailed long-form articles with real applications most programmers can use. Articles are thorough and provide a sense of expert knowledge, and the writing is above average. The formatting is not always the best, but the content is otherwise solid. Each article contains multiple visuals but, unfortunately, doesn’t include many supporting links.

    <p>Getaround.tech is the blog for the peer-to-peer car rental start-up. Articles are geared towards programmers, and while there isn’t a huge archive, the articles are highly applicable and not confined to their company’s product. Posts are detailed and provide thorough explanations from start to finish. Articles are informative and thorough but hindered by occasional grammar mistakes and run-ons. They currently publish a handful of articles every year.</p>

    <p>This concludes my hunt to identify, analyze, and rank the best JavaScript blogs in 2020. While my grading system may not be perfect, it allowed me to assign some numerical value to each blog and let the data do the talking. It’s a satisfying approach for the technical blogger in me.</p>
